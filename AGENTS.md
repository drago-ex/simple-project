# Agent Guide

Use this file as package-specific guidance when working in this repository. Keep changes aligned with the existing public API, project conventions, and supported PHP range.

## Package Overview
- **Package**: `drago-ex/simple-project`
- **Type**: project
- **Purpose**: Basic project for creating single-page sites with Drago Simple.
- **PHP**: >=8.3 <9
- **Runtime dependencies**: tracy/tracy (^2.7), latte/latte (^3.1.2), drago-ex/simple (^3.0), drago-ex/project-docker (^1.0)
- **License**: MIT

## Repository Layout
- `app/`: project application configuration and code.
- `docker/`, `docker-compose.yaml`: Docker configuration copied from `drago-ex/project-docker` by `drago-install` after `composer install`; not part of this repository.
- `www/`: web root files.
- `.github/`: CI workflows; keep their PHP versions and commands consistent with Composer and the package scripts.
- `composer.json`: package metadata, dependency constraints, autoloading, and available Composer scripts.

## Dependencies

Composer constraints describe the package contract. Before changing integration behavior, inspect the source and the actual call sites in this package; do not infer runtime usage solely from dependency declarations.
Development dependencies include phpstan/phpstan-nette (^2.0), drago-ex/project-tools (^1.0).

## Essential Commands

```bash
composer phpstan                # phpstan analyse
```

## Tests

This repository does not currently define a test script in `composer.json` or contain a `tests/` directory.
Do not claim behavior is covered by tests unless you find and run a relevant suite. When adding a test suite, follow the package’s existing Nette Tester setup if one is present and add an explicit Composer script.

## Installation Hooks

Composer install and update hooks invoke Drago project setup/cleanup commands. Inspect those scripts and their effects before invoking Composer operations that trigger them; they may modify generated project files.

## Conventions & Rules

- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly permits a breaking change. Check callers and public signatures before changing behavior.
- Follow the existing PHP style: strict types, explicit parameter and return types, tabs for indentation, and single-quoted strings where practical. Match nearby code when a convention is unclear.
- Keep package-specific configuration, resources, and migrations in their established directories. Do not edit generated or consuming-project files without confirming they are part of this repository’s intended output.
- Add or update focused tests for behavioral changes when this package has a runnable test setup. Do not invent test commands; use only the scripts and configuration present here.
- Update README examples and Composer metadata when a public API or supported requirement changes.
